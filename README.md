## Reason For Project

This project has been built for the Code Institute Full Stack Frameworks with Django Milestone Final Project .
The brief was to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. It should have an authentication mechanism and provide paid access to the site's data.

Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members.
The site owner advances their own goals by providing this functionality, potentially by being a regular user themselves. The site owner might also benefit 
from the collection of the dataset as a whole.

The main technologies that are to be used for this project are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django,Relational database (recommending MySQL or Postgres), Stripe payments, Additional libraries and APIs

I have decided to create a project based on the Issue Tracker idea. It will Report and track work on bugs and other issues with a product they like.

The wireframes for this website can be found in the repository within Github in the directory "media/img/Wireframes",
